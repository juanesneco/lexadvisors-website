      <p>The Responsible is not required to obtain the Data Subject's consent for the processing of their personal data in the following cases: (i) the data is obtained from publicly accessible sources (personal data that is publicly available); (ii) the personal data has been subjected to a dissociation process, making the Data Subject unidentifiable by the Responsible; (iii) to fulfill contractual obligations between the Data Subject and the Responsible; (iv) an emergency arises that could potentially harm an individual or their property; (v)  treatment for medical care, prevention, diagnosis, provision of health care services, or health service management, in cases where the Data Subject is not in a condition to provide consent, in accordance with the General Health Law and other applicable legal provisions, and where such data is processed by a person subject to professional confidentiality or an equivalent obligation; or (vi) when required by court order, legal resolution, justified mandate by a competent authority, or applicable legal provision.</p>
      <h3>5.- MEANS FOR EXERCISING THE DATA SUBJECT'S RIGHTS REGARDING THE PROCESSING OF THEIR PERSONAL DATA.</h3>
      <p>The Data Subject has the right to "access" their personal data held by the Responsible, by submitting a request to the designated person in charge, through any of the Responsible's records, files, and storage systems. Accordingly, the Data Subject may at any time request access, "rectify", cancel, correct or oppose (if the processing causes harm, damage, or involves automated processing with adverse legal effects) to the processing of their personal data (ARCO rights), when such data is inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the Data Subject has the right, when applicable, to request the cancellation of their personal data from the files, records, archives, and systems of the Responsible, which will initiate a blocking period pursuant to Article 24 of the Law. However, such blocking and/or cancellation may not be possible when the nature of the Responsible's profession, vulnerable activity, or function involving public trust requires the blocking and/or cancellation cannot be implemented, as provided by applicable laws.</p>
      <p>To exercise these rights, the Data Subject or their legal representative may submit a written request to the Responsible, including at least the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name of the Data Subject and address or other means for receiving notifications.</li>
        <li>Documents proving the identity of the Data Subject, or where applicable, the legal representation thereof.</li>
        <li>A clear and precise description of the personal data with respect to which the ARCO rights are intended to be exercised.</li>
        <li>Any other element or document that facilitates the location of the personal data.</li>
        <li>In the case of a request for rectification of personal data, the modifications to be made and the documents supporting the change must be indicated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Responsible has designated the individual responsible for processing ARCO rights requests of the Data Subject, such requests may be submitted by email to María Isabel Yee Savin at <a href="mailto:marisayee@lexadvisors.com.mx">marisayee@lexadvisors.com.mx</a>, or by means of  certified mail through Servicio Postal Mexicano (Correos de México) or another courier service that provides delivery confirmation, or in person at the following address: Paseo Finisterra No. 136, Suites 2, 6 y 10, colonia Campo de Golf, San José del Cabo, Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, 23406 México. Attention: María Isabel Yee Savin.</p>
      <p>The Responsible will respond within the timeframes established in Articles 30, 31, 32, and 33 of the Law.</p>
      <p>The Responsible hereby informs the Data Subject that the right to object will not be applicable when the processing of data is required to comply with a legal obligation imposed on the Responsible, or when, due to the nature of the Responsible's profession, vulnerable activity, or public trust function, such objection or cancellation cannot be exercised under applicable laws.</p>
      <p>The Responsible informs the Data Subject that exercising ARCO rights is free of charge. However, if rectification of personal data in a public instrument is required due to changes made after the execution of such instrument, the correction will be subject to applicable fees, duties, and costs, which the Data Subject or their representative hereby accepts.</p>
      <p>In addition, if the Data Subject expressly requests and authorizes the Responsible in writing to share their information and/or documentation with a third party unrelated to the original purpose for which the data was collected, whether by email or other means, such disclosure or transfer (physical or electronic) may incur costs and expenses payable by the Data Subject, which the Data Subject or their representative expressly accepts.</p>
      <h3>6.- CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY NOTICE.</h3>
      <p>The Responsible reserves the right to modify this Privacy Notice. In said case, the changes will be communicated through a notice placed in a visible location at the Responsible's address and on the website <a href="http://www.lexadvisorsmx.com/">www.lexadvisorsmx.com</a>, and the Data Subject shall consult the Privacy Notice at the aforementioned website or at the Responsible's physical address.</p>
      <h3>7.- INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA.</h3>
      <p>The Responsible may transfer the Data Subject's personal data internationally (through manual or automated procedures), without the Data Subject's consent when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provided by a law or treaty to which Mexico is a party;</li>
        <li>The transfer is made to entities within the same corporate group or any other company of the same group that operates under the same internal processes and policies as the Responsible;</li>
        <li>The transfer is necessary due to a contract entered into in the interest of the Data Subject;</li>
        <li>It is necessary for the safeguarding of public interest or the administration of justice;</li>
        <li>It is necessary for the recognition, exercise, or defense of a right in a judicial proceeding; and</li>
        <li>It is necessary for the maintenance or fulfillment of a legal relationship between the Responsible and the Data Subject.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>8.- APPLICATION OF THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR or RGPD for its acronym in Spanish) OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.</h3>
      <p>The Responsible makes every reasonable effort to ensure proper use of personal data; how it is obtained, how it is protected; and for how long it is retained, regarding individuals or legal entities that are part of the European Economic Area, when applicable, pursuant to article 3, fraction V of the Mexican Data Protection Law, articles 4, 5, and Third Section of the Regulation of the Law, article 3.2 of the GDPR and other relevant provisions of said legislation, including the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data and its Additional Protocol regarding supervisory authorities and transborder data flows, published on June 12, 2018.</p>
      <p>This regulation applies to the processing of personal data by a responsible not established in the Union but located in a place where the law of the Member States applies by virtue of Public International Law.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Mexican data protection regulations provide that the Data Subject may exercise their ARCO rights in Mexico, and the application of other foreign laws shall remain secondary, in accordance with the principles of Public International Law.</p>
      <h3>9.- IMPACT OF UNITED STATES DATA PROTECTION LAWS ON DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES IN MEXICO.</h3>
      <p>Data protection requirements include the following: i.- Publication of a privacy notice (through manual or electronic means); ii.- The Data Subject has rights such as access, cancellation, rectification, and opposition concerning their personal data held by the Responsible or related third parties; iii.- Reasonable efforts are made to maintain security processes for data protection; iv.- The Responsible does not collect personal information from minors without the prior consent of parents and/or guardians.</p>
      <p>As established under Mexican data protection law, the Data Subject may exercise their ARCO rights in Mexico, with the application of foreign laws remaining secondary and subject to the rules of Public International Law.</p>
      <h3>9A.- IMPACT OF CANADIAN LAW ON DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES IN MEXICO.</h3>
      <p>The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) of Canada provides that those responsible for collecting, storing, and managing the personal data of Canadian individuals (whether by birth or naturalization) must comply with the obligations set forth in that Act, even when outside Canadian territory. However, Mexican data protection law provides that the Data Subject may exercise their ARCO rights in Mexico, and the application of PIPEDA remains secondary, subject to the rules of Public International Law.</p>
      <h3>10.- INQUIRIES.</h3>
      <p>For any questions, comments, concerns, or requests regarding this Notice and pursuant to Article 28 of the Law, the Data Subject may consult the Privacy Notice at the Responsible's address or on the website <a href="http://www.lexadvisorsmx.com/">www.lexadvisorsmx.com</a>, or submit a written request to the following address: Paseo Finisterra No. 136, Suites 2, 6 y 10, colonia Campo de Golf, San José del Cabo, Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, 23406, México, to the attention of: María Isabel Yee Savin.</p>
